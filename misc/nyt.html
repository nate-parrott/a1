Mr. Musk is counting on the midsize Model 3 to drive revenue higher, stabilize Tesla&#x2019;s finances and enable the company to begin generating profits.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\">He has said that Tesla will make money in the second half of the year if it is able to produce 5,000 or more Model 3s a week, a level that he predicted would be reached by the end of the month. At the company&#x2019;s shareholder meeting this month, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/business/tesla-once-a-wall-street-darling-faces-investor-challenge.html\">Mr. Musk said</a> the company had increased its output to about 3,500 Model 3s a week, up from around 2,000 a week in early May.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\">Tesla seemingly has no shortage of customers ready to buy the car. It took $1,000 deposits from nearly 400,000 people even before it began making the Model 3 last summer. A large portion of those customers, however, were expecting to buy a basic version that is priced at $35,000 but has not yet gone into production. For now, the company is making versions that sell for $50,000 and more.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\">&#x201C;What versions they are producing are almost as important as how many they are producing a week,&#x201D; said Rebecca Lindland, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book, an automotive research firm. &#x201C;They&#x2019;ve been talking about a mainstream car that anybody can afford but what they&#x2019;re making are still luxury cars that most buyers can&#x2019;t afford.&#x201D;</p></div><aside class=\"css-14jsv4e\"><span></span></aside></div><div class=\"css-18sbwfn StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-1h6whtw\"><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\">Ms. Lindland said that she had sent a deposit for a base-price Model 3, but that she asked for a refund earlier this year when she realized that only the higher-priced versions would be available.</p></div><aside class=\"css-14jsv4e\"><span></span></aside></div><figure class=\"css-l1fb44 e1a8i6eb0\"><div class=\"css-1xdhyk6 e1vv25i80\"><span class=\"css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0\">Image</span><img alt=\"\" class=\"css-1m50asq\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/20/business/20TESLA-2/merlin_139148079_de990c3d-ebda-43d5-a4f1-c60d854da68c-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/20/business/20TESLA-2/merlin_139148079_de990c3d-ebda-43d5-a4f1-c60d854da68c-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/20/business/20TESLA-2/merlin_139148079_de990c3d-ebda-43d5-a4f1-c60d854da68c-jumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/20/business/20TESLA-2/merlin_139148079_de990c3d-ebda-43d5-a4f1-c60d854da68c-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 2048w\"></div><figcaption class=\"css-1wtlzrm e3zkro30\"><span class=\"css-fko7t5 e1olku6u0\">A Tesla showroom in Manhattan.

Defying critics, the company has proved that there is a viable market for electric cars and that they can command premium prices. It has pioneered methods of upgrading cars through software updates beamed over the air, the way iPhones can download operating systems. Taking an approach never tried before, Mr. Musk also built a gigantic factory in Nevada to reduce the costs of battery packs through vast scale.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\">At the same time, Tesla and its chief have experienced setbacks. At least three fatal accidents have occurred in the United States involving Tesla vehicles that were operating with the company&#x2019;s Autopilot driver-assistance system engaged, drawing scrutiny from federal safety officials and raising questions about the system&#x2019;s reliability. Mr. Musk also overestimated Tesla&#x2019;s ability to mass-produce the Model 3; he once expected the company to churn out several hundred thousand in 2018.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\">While Tesla&#x2019;s share price has made it more valuable than Ford and close behind General Motors, its shares were down almost 5 percent on Tuesday.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\">One constant since Tesla was founded in 2003: the company has lost money every year. Tesla has several times raised money from investors to develop its cars and put them into production, and some analysts are concerned because the company must begin paying back some debt later this year.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\">Earlier this year, Moody&#x2019;s Investor Service <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-downgrades-Teslas-corporate-family-rating-to-B3-senior-notes--PR_381481\">cut Tesla&#x2019;s credit rating</a>, noting that it could face a cash crunch if it failed to hit its Model 3 production targets. Just last week, Mr. Musk announced that Tesla was <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/business/tesla-staff-cuts.html\">eliminating the jobs</a> of about 3,500 people to cut costs.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\">In his email reporting sabotage, Mr. Musk seemed to stoke the notion that enemies of Tesla were working against it.</p></div><aside class=\"css-14jsv4e\"><span></span></aside></div><div class=\"css-18sbwfn StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-1h6whtw\"><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\">&#x201C;As you know, there are a long list of organizations that want Tesla to die,&#x201D; he wrote. &#x201C;These include Wall Street short-sellers, who have already lost billions of dollars and stand to lose a lot more.&#x201D; He also pointed to oil and gas companies, which, he said, &#x201C;don&#x2019;t love the idea of Tesla advancing progress of solar power &amp; electric cars.&#x201D; Of rival automakers, he added that &#x201C;if they&#x2019;re willing to cheat so much about emissions, maybe they&#x2019;re willing to cheat in other ways?&#x201D;</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\">The employee thought to have harmed Tesla&#x2019;s manufacturing system was not identified in the email, but Mr. Musk said the worker had admitted trying to damage the manufacturing system and was unhappy with the company after being passed over for a promotion.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\">The email was <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/18/elon-musk-email-employee-conducted-extensive-and-damaging-sabotage.html\">first reported</a> by CNBC. A Tesla spokesman declined to discuss the content of Mr. Musk&#x2019;s emails.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\">In a separate email to employees on Monday, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/18/elon-musk-email-tesla-factory-paint-shop-fire-sunday.html\">also reported</a> by CNBC, Mr. Musk said a minor fire had broken out on the assembly line at its Fremont plant, halting production for several hours. He said it &#x201C;could be just a random event&#x201D; but added that it was &#x201C;hard to explain&#x201D; and urged employees to keep any eye out for any suspicious activity inside the company.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\">&#x201C;This is when outside forces have the strongest motivation to stop us,&#x201D; Mr. Musk wrote.</p></div><aside class=\"css-14jsv4e\"><span></span></aside></div><div class=\"bottom-of-article\"><p class=\"css-3glrhn\">A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Tesla Finds A Saboteur On the Inside<span>. <a href=\"http://www.nytreprints.com/\">Order Reprints</a> | <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html\">Today&#x2019;s Paper</a> | <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY\">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><span></span></article>"
